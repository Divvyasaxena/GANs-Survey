**New taxonomy.** In this study, we identify key research issues within each design and optimization technique and present a novel taxonomy to structure solutions by key research issues. Our proposed taxonomy will facilitate researchers to enhance the understanding of the current developments handling GANs challenges and future research directions.

**Comprehensive survey.** In accordance with the taxonomy, we provide a comprehensive review of different solutions proposed to handle the major GANs challenges. For each type of solution, we provide detailed descriptions and systematic analysis of the GANs variants and their relationships. But still, due to the wide range of GANs applications, different GANs variants are formulated, trained, and evaluated in heterogenous ways and direct comparison among these GANs is complicated. Therefore, we make a necessary comparison and summarize the corresponding approaches w.r.to their novel solutions to address GANs challenges. We provide a detailed investigation into the numerous research domains where GANs has been broadly explored. This survey can be used as a guide for understanding, using, and developing different GANs approaches for various real-life applications.

**Future directions.** This survey also highlights the most promising future research directions.
